# 🧱 Tetris but You're the Gaps

**Remix Jam Submission – Theme: Flip the Script**

In this puzzle game, you flip the classic Tetris mechanic on its head. Instead of placing blocks, you *are* the empty space. Dodge incoming blocks, survive as long as you can, and experience what it’s like to be the void.

## 🎮 Gameplay

- You control a single "gap" in a falling wall of blocks.
- Blocks fall automatically from the top.
- Move horizontally to avoid being filled.
- If a block lands on your position: game over.

---

## 🧠 Concept

- **Genre**: Puzzle / Reverse Tetris
- **Twist**: You’re the gap, not the builder.
- **Inspiration**: Classic Tetris, inverted.
- **Tech**: HTML5 + Canvas API (lightweight and remix-friendly)

## 🔧 Controls

- ⬅️ / ➡️ arrow keys to move the gap
- Spacebar to pause (optional)
- Mobile: swipe left/right (future version)

---

## 🚀 Remix Ideas

- Gravity modes: blocks fall sideways or even upward
- Power-ups: teleportation, slow motion, invisibility
- Multiple gaps: co-op mode or chaos mode
- Custom shapes: add your own block patterns
